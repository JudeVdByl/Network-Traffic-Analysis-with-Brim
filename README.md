# Network-Traffic-Analysis-with-Brim
This project demonstrates how I performed network traffic analysis using **Brim** to investigate various types of network activity, including DNS queries, NTP logs, Suricata alerts, and more. Throughout the project, I explored packet capture (PCAP) data and extracted crucial information for security investigations.
